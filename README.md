You will want to download all the files in the repo into a folder. Then add in the text file of the list of points in the folder. Then simply go to your command prompt on your operating system and make sure the path matches the one where you put your folder. Make sure you have python installed on your computer and run python main.py. Then enter in the name of that text file (make sure you include the “.txt” at the end). The program will run until you press Enter.
